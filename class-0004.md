# OOP : object-oriented programming

**Object-oriented programming combines a group of data attributes with functions or methods into a unit called an "object." Typically, OOP languages are class-based, which means that a class defines the data attributes and functions as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class.**

## Objects
objects provide "encapsulation," meaning the data within an object is protected from being modified or destroyed by other functions or methods unless explicitly allowed.

## Class 
is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

## Inheritance 
is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the Parent class. And the class that inherits the properties from the parent class is the Child class.

## Interface
is an architectural pattern for implementing modular programming at the component level in an object-oriented programming language which does not have a module system.

## package 
is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner. Placing your code into packages makes large software projects easier to manage. 


## Binary code
code used in digital computers, based on a binary number system in which there are only two possible states, off and on, usually symbolized by 0 and 1.

## hexadecimal
 numeral system, often shortened to "hex", is a numeral system made up of 16 symbols (base 16). 

## decimal
 system has been extended to infinite decimals for representing any real number, by using an infinite sequence of digits after the decimal separator (see decimal representation). In this context,
