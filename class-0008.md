 # Rule of Three (code duplication)
 is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when a replicated piece of code should be replaced by a new procedure. It states that you are allowed to copy and paste the code once, but that when the same code is replicated three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure. The rule was introduced by Martin Fowler in his text "Refactoring" and attributed to Don Roberts.

things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."

# Minimum viable product (MVP)

The minimum viable product is a perfect opportunity to let potential users voice their opinions and test out a product before its final launch.
