# Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming
### A familiar problem
* Very simple functionality, easily explainable, but most importantly, easily understood.
By creating a familiar problem domain, I found that both the tasks of me teaching a new technology and the viewer learning that technology were much easier, because it is very difficult to learn more than one thing at once.Simply that by taking away the problem domain, or making it so trivial that it is easily understood, I am able to make both teaching and learning easier.

### Why problem domains are hard
- Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.

- The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all.


### Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain
- Make the problem domain easier. 

You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

= Get better at understanding the problem domain.

Best to resist the temptation to “not waste anymore time talking” and make sure you understand a problem inside and out before you try and solve it with code.

# WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 

**Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.**

- IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES.
- IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS .


### This object represents a hotel. It has five properties and one method. The object is in curly braces. It is stored in a variable called hotel
