# Spring Framework

 application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model, it has become popular in the Java community as an addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model. The Spring Framework is open source.

 ## Spring model 
 
 attributess an annotation that binds a method parameter or method return value to a named model attribute and then exposes it to a web view.

## Request parameters
  we can use @RequestParam to extract query parameters, form parameters, and even files from the request.

## Session attributes

   a session indicates a period of time that a single user visits a website. A session starts when the user requests for the first page. And during a session, the user can view as many pages as he wants. The session ends if the user hasn’t requested any pages for a given amount of time (timeout). The session timeout varies, depend on server configuration – typically from 15 to 30 minutes.

## ServletContext attributes

1. request scope.
2. session scope.
3. application scope.

## Spring beans

the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container.
