# what is Git?
***  is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.***

 ## the step

1. git clone by the link 
2. add the  text after edit it that's by "git add ." command
3. then commit it that's by "git commit -m "etc." " command
4. and push it by "git push origin main" command

* ### what if i edit something from GitHup?

***the git will be reject the push command, the solution is "git pull" command.***

## other useful command

- _ "git remote -v" By using this command you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names._
- _ "git fetch [remote-name]" Fetching entails pulling data that you don’t have from a remote project. _
